            <h1>Stratego Rules</h1>

            <h2 class="scroll" id="outline-of-the-game">Outline of the game</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Both players have an army of 10 (Stratego Duel) or 40 (Stratego Original) pieces,
                    including a flag. You must try to capture your opponent’s flag while protecting
                    your own. You first put together a secret formation by placing your playing
                    pieces on your half of the game board in such a way as to conceal their rank from your opponent. In
                    other words, you
                    place your pieces and your opponent place theirs. The pieces have a
                    specific sequence:
                    the higher the number, the higher the rank. If a piece with a higher rank takes a piece with a lower
                    rank, the piece with
                    the higher rank wins and the piece with the lower rank is taken off the board. The flag can be
                    conquered
                    by any of the
                    enemy’s pieces that can be moved.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="playing-pieces-and-formation">The playing pieces and formation</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Each piece has its own illustration and number indicating its rank. The field Marshal has the highest
                    rank and has been
                    assigned the number 10, the General has a 9, etc., down to the Spy with the number 1. Only the bombs
                    and flag do not have a number because they have a special role in the game.</p>
                <p>You position your pieces on the bottom four rows of the game board. The two middle rows (with the
                    lakes) remain empty. No playing pieces may
                    be placed here when setting up the game. Setting up the board is an important part of the game. It
                    determines whether you win or lose. </p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="course-of-the-game">Course of the game</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Red starts. The players then move their pieces in turns. You move a piece to an empty field or to a
                    field occupied by one of your opponent’s pieces. The latter option is called an attack.
                    Each player may only move a single piece during his or her turn!</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="moving-rules">Moving</h3>
            <div>
                <p>You can move a piece one place to the left or right, or one place forward or backward. The Scout (number
                    2) is an exception to this rule; more details below. Each field can accommodate one piece only;
                    the pieces cannot jump over
                    other pieces and they may not be moved diagonally.The playing pieces may not be positioned in or
                    jump over the two lakes in the center of the board.
                    The bombs and the flag may never be moved and therefore remain in the same place throughout the
                    duration of the game.</p>
                <p>Special rules apply to the Scouts (2). Scouts can jump over an unlimited number of empty fields. Of
                    course, they can only do so in a straight line, i.e. to the left, to the right, forward or backward.
                    As far
                    as they can as long as the fields are empty, because they cannot jump over their own army’s pieces
                    or those of the enemy. Neither can they jump over the lakes. Scouts are the only pieces that can
                    launch an attack from a sizeable distance.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="attacking-rules">Attacking</h3>
            <div>
                <p>If one of your pieces is immediately in front of, next to or behind one of your
                    opponent’s pieces, you can attack that piece.
                    Attacks are launched as follows: Select your piece. Move it onto your opponent and then you get to
                    know if you win, lose or draw.</p>
                <p>The piece with the lowest rank loses and is removed from the board. If the
                    attacking piece wins, it takes the place of the losing piece. If the defending piece
                    wins it simply remains where it was.
                    If you attack a piece of the same rank, both pieces lose and are removed from the
                    board. You are never obliged to attack.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, Scouts can attack from a considerable distance. The fields
                    in between must be empty, though, and the Scout must move in a straight line. A
                    Scout (2) can therefore eliminate a Spy (1) from a sizeable distance.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="rank-rules">The ranks</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The Field Marshal (10) outranks a General (9) and all the pieces of a lower rank. The General (9)
                    outranks the Colonels
                    (8) and all the lower ranks. This applies down to the Spy (1), which holds the lowest rank. The
                    ranks are depicted in the
                    correct order on the screen and are listed at the beginning of these instructions where they are
                    given by name and rank
                    (and number). It’s a good idea to memorize the ranks. Of course, you can play with just
                    the numbers – i.e. my “8” beats your “5” – but it sounds better to say my “Colonel” beats
                    your “Lieutenant”.</p>
                <p>Bombs and Miners: (3). Any piece that attacks a bomb loses. The bomb stays in the
                    same place. The only exception to this rule is the Miner. If a Miner attacks a bomb it
                    becomes inactive and must be removed from play. The Miner then takes the place of
                    the destroyed bomb.</p>
                <p>The Spy (1) holds the lowest rank. Any piece that attacks a Spy wins.
                    But, the mysterious and resourceful Spy can also be very powerful. If a Spy attacks a
                    Field Marshal (10), she outsmarts him and wins the battle!
                    This only applies if the Spy launches the attack. If the Field Marshal attacks, it beats
                    a Spy and clears it from the board.
                    The Flag can be conquered by any piece. This includes a jumping Scout!</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="original-rules">Stratego Original</h3>
            <div>
                <p>All the pieces are used when playing Stratego Original. Each player therefore uses 40 playing pieces.
                    This means that
                    when setting up all the fields, the bottom four rows are filled. The object of the game Stratego is
                    to capture your enemy’s flag. It would also be wise to position your flag somewhere at the rear,
                    making it more difficult to capture instantly. You only have six bombs to use as extra protection
                    for your flag. You must divide your high and low pieces evenly across
                    the field so that your opponent has a harder time</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="duel-rules">Stratego Duel</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The pieces are set up on the bottom four rows of the game board.
                    You can therefore choose from 40 fields for your 10 pieces. You
                    could, for example, position all your pieces at the back in a corner,
                    and then protect your flag with two bombs. The
                    advantage here is that only the enemy miners can capture the flag,
                    because they alone can sweep the bombs. The disadvantage is
                    that your opponent will immediately know where to look for the flag
                    once the screen has gone. You can choose the smartest formation
                    for yourself.</p>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="infiltrator-rules">Stratego Infiltrator</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Play the game with only 7 Scouts and the Infiltrator (a total of 40 playing pieces). Play as you
                    would
                    Stratego Original, except for the special rules that apply to the Infiltrator.</p>
                <p>The Infiltrator holds the lowest rank (1). Any piece that attacks
                    it wins. But he does have one special power! The Infiltrator
                    comes into his own when operating on enemy territory where
                    he can use his special power. When in enemy territory, he can
                    ‘infiltrate’ which means he can attack an enemy playing piece
                    from one or two spaces away. Tap the enemy piece, tell your
                    opponent you are infiltrating and guess the rank of the piece
                    you are attacking.</p>
                <p>If you guessed correctly, that piece loses. The Infiltrator does NOT take the place
                    of the losing piece but returns to the field where he was.
                    If you guessed incorrectly, the defending piece stays where it was and the
                    Infiltrator returns to the field where he was. Your opponent now knows the
                    position of your Infiltrator!</p>

            <h3 class="scroll" id="winner-rules">The winner</h3>
            <div>
                <p>You can win the game by conquering your opponent’s flag. You also win if your opponent cannot move
                    anything. This
                    would be the case if your opponent were left with only bombs and a flag, or if bombs block the path
                    of
                    his or her last
                    moving pieces.</p>
